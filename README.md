Semantic segmentation via efficient attention augmented convolutional networks.

# Prepare Dataset
The dataset this project uses is Augmented PASCAL VOC, which is made of PASCAL VOC 2012 and Semantic Boundaries Dataset. The directory structures of these two datasets are as below:

```)


The annotations in PASCAL VOC 2012 are colorful images of png type while those in Semantic Boundaries Dataset are of mat type. So we transform all the annotations into grayscale images before combining these two datasets.
